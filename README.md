# Psychic-Game
This project was the most difficult for me. I definitely resorted back to alot of the class activities/videos/and for-loop references to gain a better understanding. 

I first created my HTML and my CSS styling. 

Then I saved my reset.CSS. 

In my Javascript, I first set up my array of letter choices defined as "computerChoices".  I then set up my variables to define guesses, losses, wins, etc.

I had some difficulty setting up the event key function later in my code and had to go back and define it in my variables. I kept getting an "userGuess" isn't defined. 

I found the window.onload function via google research, similiar to the download ready function shown in class.
